## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science, providing efficient ways to organize and manage data. This repository includes common data structures implemented in C++, along with examples to demonstrate their use cases.

## Data Structures Implemented

The following data structures are included in this repository:

- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Binary Trees**
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **Heaps**
- **Graphs**
- **Hash Tables**

Each implementation is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, with accompanying comments to explain key concepts.
